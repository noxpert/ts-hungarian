# TS-Hungarian

This was built as a multi-faceted learning exercise.

I am new to TypeScript and not very experienced with Node.JS. I am also refreshing my long dormant Hungarian knowledge.

This is intended to be a REST service to support studying Hungarian, which will facilitate my learning more about TypeScript and Node.
